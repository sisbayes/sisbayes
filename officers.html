          <p>  Isadora Antoniano-Villalobos is an Associate Professor of Statistics at Ca' Foscari University of Venice (Italy) and a Research Affiliate at 
               the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics. She holds a BSc in Applied Mathematics (ITAM), an MSc in Mathematical Sciences (UNAM), where she 
               discovered her love for Stochastic Processes and Bayesian Nonparametrics, and a PhD from the University of Kent (UK). Before joining Ca' Foscari in 2018, 
               she was a Postdoctoral Fellow and Assistant Professor at Bocconi University. Her research focuses on Bayesian nonparametrics, the modeling of complex dependence structures, 
               and extreme value analysis, with particular applications in hydrology. She is also interested in objective Bayesian methods and minimal informativeness in different contexts. 
               An active member of ISBA, she has recently been elected Secretary of its Objective Bayes Section.

          <p>   Federico Camerlenghi is an Associate Professor of Statistics in the Department of Economics, Management and Statistics at the University of Milano-Bicocca. 
                He earned the Ph.D. in Mathematics and Statistics from University of Pavia in 2015, and he has been awarded two prizes for his doctoral dissertation: 
                the best Ph.D. Thesis in Statistics (Italian Statistical Society, 2016) and the Savage Award in Theory & Methods (International Society for Bayesian Analysis, 2017). 
                He is a member of the PhD board in Economics, Statistics and Data Science (University of Milano-Bicocca), where he is actively involved in teaching, and he regularly 
                supervises Ph.D. students. His research focuses primarily on nonparametric statistics (classical and Bayesian), with a particular interest in species and feature sampling models, 
                mixture models and clustering. Recently, he received two prizes for his research contributions: the Bicocca Young talents award (2019) and the Early-Career Scholar Award for 
                Contributions to Statistics (2022), assigned yearly by the Italian Statistical Society (SIS). Federico has been actively involved in serving national and international academic societies,
                and currently serves as an Associate Editor for the *Electronic Journal of Statistics* and *Statistical Methods & Applications*.
