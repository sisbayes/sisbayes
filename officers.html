          <span class="image left"><img src="images/bio_camerlenghi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
          <p>   Federico Camerlenghi is an Associate Professor of Statistics in the Department of Economics, Management and Statistics at the University of Milano-Bicocca. 
                He earned the Ph.D. in Mathematics and Statistics from University of Pavia in 2015, and he has been awarded two prizes for his doctoral dissertation: 
                the best Ph.D. Thesis in Statistics (Italian Statistical Society, 2016) and the Savage Award in Theory & Methods (International Society for Bayesian Analysis, 2017). 
                He is a member of the PhD board in Economics, Statistics and Data Science (University of Milano-Bicocca), where he is actively involved in teaching, and he regularly 
                supervises Ph.D. students. His research focuses primarily on nonparametric statistics (classical and Bayesian), with a particular interest in species and feature sampling models, 
                mixture models and clustering. Recently, he received two prizes for his research contributions: the Bicocca Young talents award (2019) and the Early-Career Scholar Award for 
                Contributions to Statistics (2022), assigned yearly by the Italian Statistical Society (SIS). Federico has been actively involved in serving national and international academic societies,
                and currently serves as an Associate Editor for the <em>Electronic Journal of Statistics</em> and <em>Statistical Methods & Applications</em>.
